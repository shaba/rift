# Changelog

All notable changes to rift. Versions follow the roadmap phases in
[docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md); dates are release dates.

## v2.9.0 — 2026-09-17

- **Typed decisions: TypeSafe System One (Jev) support.** A System One model
  is not a chat model — it generates no text, calls no tools and does not
  stream. It takes state plus typed questions and returns typed answers with
  calibrated probabilities in a single round trip. That makes it the wrong
  shape for a `Provider` and the right shape for the judgements rift was
  previously phrasing as prompts and parsing back out of prose. New
  `crates/rift-typesafe` speaks `POST /v1/systemone` with all three
  primitives — `noul` (yes/no probability), `choice` (one of a set, with a
  probability per option and a confidence) and `score` (a position on an
  ordered rubric) — and models the fact that **only choice and score carry a
  confidence**, so a noul can never contribute a fabricated one to a gate.
  Retries 429/529 with backoff; never retries a 401 or a 422.
- **New `decide` tool.** The model asks its own typed questions mid-turn and
  gets a value to branch on instead of a hunch. All questions go in one call
  (state is billed once per call, not once per question), and malformed
  questions are rejected locally rather than costing a round trip. With no
  API key configured the tool stays registered but inert, explaining how to
  enable it instead of erroring cryptically.
- **`--judge jev`: a typed swarm referee.** The chat judge has to be *asked*
  for a `WINNER:` line and then parsed — which can miss the line, name a
  candidate that does not exist, or pick one that changed nothing (the rule
  it was given in prose, then re-checked in code). The System One judge makes
  the winner a `choice` over **only** the candidates that actually produced a
  patch, so an illegal pick is unrepresentable rather than merely forbidden,
  and asks a separate yes/no in the same call to gate whether any candidate
  solved the task at all. Verdicts carry a calibrated confidence; low-confidence
  picks are flagged for review rather than presented as clean recommendations.
  `--judge <chat-model>` is unchanged.
- **TypeSafe credentials are user-config only.** A project `.rift.json`
  cannot set `typesafe` — it is ignored with a warning, the same treatment
  `editor` gets. A cloned repo must not be able to redirect where an API key
  is sent. The client also defaults its scheme to **https**, unlike rift's
  LAN-first model hosts, so a bearer token is never defaulted onto cleartext.

## v2.8.8 — 2026-08-28

- **Restores everything from v2.8.0–v2.8.6.** v2.8.7 was cut from a branch
  that had not seen the 2.8.x line, so it shipped the `/host`, `/model` and
  `/ctx` persistence fix on top of a v2.7.1 tree — meaning anyone who updated
  to it lost drag-to-select, Ctrl+V and right-click paste, the multi-line
  paste fix, the `/restart`-after-`/update` fix on Linux, the clipboard
  helpers no longer printing over the TUI, the TCP keepalive that keeps a NAT
  from reaping a turn mid-stream, and the musl/CI build fixes. This release
  merges those branches back together: the TUI, the VS Code extension and the
  desktop app are all built from one tree again. **If you are on v2.8.7,
  update.**
- **`cargo clippy -D warnings` passes on current stable again.** A
  `drain(..).collect()` in the task-notes handler became a hard error under
  clippy's `drain_collect` lint, failing CI on all three platforms.

## v2.8.7 — 2026-08-28

- **`/host`, `/model` and `/ctx` now stick.** Switching the server, model or
  context window in the TUI changed only the running session — every setting
  reverted on the next launch, so the one place you would naturally change
  them was the one place that could not remember them. All three now write
  the new value back to config the moment the switch succeeds, and the next
  session starts on it. The write goes to whichever file actually governs the
  key: a project `.rift.json` that already sets it (it outranks the user
  config at load, so saving user-side would silently lose next launch),
  otherwise `~/.config/rift/config.json`, created if absent. Every other key
  in the file is preserved. An unwritable config warns instead of quietly
  undoing the switch. `RIFT_HOST`/`RIFT_MODEL` still outrank the config at
  launch by design — when one is set, the save now says so rather than
  looking like it did nothing.
## v2.8.6 — 2026-08-22

- **Turns died mid-stream behind a NAT with `error reading a body from
  connection: Operation timed out (os error 110)`.** That errno is the
  kernel giving up on the socket, not rift giving up on the request: a
  streaming turn sends its prompt, gets headers back immediately, then goes
  completely silent for the whole prefill — minutes, on a large context
  grown by a long tool loop. Anything tracking connections in the middle (a
  VM's NAT, a router's conntrack table, a VPN) reaps that idle mapping, and
  the server's reply has nowhere to land. It failed *after* headers, so
  `send_with_retry` could not retry it either — by then tokens may already
  have been emitted. rift set **no TCP keepalive at all**, so nothing kept
  the mapping warm. It now sends keepalive probes every 20s (NAT idle
  timeouts of 30s are common, and a probe is one empty packet), and parks
  pooled connections for 30s instead of reqwest's 90s so a connection idled
  across a long tool run is discarded rather than handed to the next turn.
- **The read-idle timeout is adjustable.** It was hardcoded at 120s, which a
  long prefill on a very large context can legitimately exceed;
  `RIFT_READ_TIMEOUT` (seconds, `0` = no limit) overrides it. A typo falls
  back to the default rather than reading as "no limit" — silently removing
  the only bound on a stalled stream is the worse failure.

## v2.8.5 — 2026-08-22

- **A right-click on a machine with no clipboard tool scribbled `sh: 1:
  xclip: not found` over the TUI.** The image fallback shells out, and the
  `2>/dev/null` in that script covered `wl-paste` only — the `xclip` after
  the `||` was unredirected, and the shell itself inherited stderr. Fallout
  from 2.8.3: before Ctrl+V and right-click existed, only an explicit
  `/paste` reached that code, so the machine most likely to print the error
  was the least likely to run it. Every platform branch now nulls stdout
  and stderr (Windows PowerShell and macOS `pngpaste` had the same
  exposure), and the redirect covers both commands in the script. Without a
  clipboard tool you get the status line that was always intended —
  `no clipboard tool — install wl-clipboard, xclip, or xsel`.

## v2.8.4 — 2026-08-22

- **`/update` then `/restart` stranded your session on Linux.** The restart
  never came back: it dropped to a shell, and the conversation you were in
  the middle of stayed unresumed on disk. `/update` installs the new binary
  by renaming it over the old one, which unlinks the running image — and
  once that inode is unlinked, Linux appends `" (deleted)"` to
  `/proc/self/exe`, which is what `current_exe()` reads. `/restart` then
  tried to exec `…/rift (deleted)` and got ENOENT. So the single flow
  `/restart` advertises — "relaunch and load updates" — was the one that
  could not work. Windows was unaffected: its update parks the *running*
  exe aside first, so the original path stays valid. The relaunch now
  resolves a `" (deleted)"` path back to the real binary, and only when
  that path is gone and the stripped one exists — a binary genuinely named
  `foo (deleted)` still launches.
- **A failed relaunch now tells you how to recover.** It used to end with a
  bare io error and no hint that the session was still sitting on disk; it
  prints the `rift --resume <path>` that brings it back.

## v2.8.3 — 2026-08-22

- **Ctrl+V and right-click now paste into the input box.** `/paste` was the
  only way in, and it only ever took images. Worse, in terminals that pass
  the keystroke through rather than claiming it (conhost, plain xterm),
  `Ctrl+V` typed a literal `v` into the prompt — the generic character arm
  caught it, because nothing matched it first. Both gestures now read the
  system clipboard: text goes in at the cursor as one insert (so newlines in
  a pasted stack trace never act as Enter), and if there is no text but
  there is an image, it stages as an attachment exactly like `/paste`.
  Terminals that already intercept `Ctrl+V` are unaffected — they paste as a
  bracketed-paste event, which rift has always handled. Right-click needs
  rift's help regardless, since mouse capture takes the click away from the
  terminal's own context menu.
- **`/copy` on Windows prepended an invisible BOM to everything.** `clip.exe`
  is fed UTF-16LE with a byte-order mark so it does not mangle non-ASCII,
  but it stores that mark as clipboard *content* — so every `/copy` and
  every drag-selection came back with a leading U+FEFF, which is invisible
  and breaks compilers, JSON parsers, and shells when pasted into a file.
  Reads now strip a leading BOM. (The write side still sends one; dropping
  it would leave clip.exe guessing the encoding.)

## v2.8.2 — 2026-08-20

- **The Linux x86_64 download could not run at all.** `curl … | sh` installed
  it and every attempt to start it answered `rift: not found` — for a file
  sitting right there, executable, 15MB. The binary carried a PT_INTERP of
  `/lib/ld-musl-x86_64.so.1` (with no shared libraries needed at all), so on
  a glibc host the kernel could not find its loader and exec failed with
  ENOENT, which the shell reports as the *binary* being missing. rustc links
  x86_64-musl as a static PIE and musl-gcc's specs stamped the dynamic
  linker in regardless; aarch64-musl links non-PIE and was unaffected, which
  is why only half the Linux downloads were broken and why nothing looked
  wrong in CI. musl targets now build with `-C relocation-model=static`.
- **CI now proves the static binary is static.** Both release jobs fail if
  the built binary has a PT_INTERP or any DT_NEEDED entry, and `dev-build`
  gained a linux-musl job that runs those checks and then executes
  `--version` on a glibc runner — the test that would have caught this
  before a tag existed.
- **The apt timeout added in 2.8.1 never worked.** `timeout` signals its
  direct child, and an unprivileged process cannot signal a root-owned
  `sudo` (EPERM), so a hung apt was never killed; 2.8.1 only looked fixed
  because apt happened not to hang. It runs as `sudo timeout` now, with
  job-level caps so no future variant can burn six hours of runner time.

## v2.8.1 — 2026-08-19

- **Pasting multi-line text no longer sends the first line by itself.**
  Windows has no bracketed paste — crossterm reads console records, not VT
  sequences — so a pasted block arrives as ordinary key events and its
  newlines were indistinguishable from Enter. Pasting a stack trace sent its
  first line to the model and stranded the second in the input box, which is
  precisely the case (dumping an error) where you want the whole thing.
  Keys that arrive faster than anyone can type are now treated as pasted
  text: Enter inserts a newline instead of sending, and Tab indents instead
  of running command completion. Redraw time is discounted from the gap, and
  a paste that arrives in chunks is carried across the pauses, so long
  pastes land whole. Press Enter afterwards to send.
- **A hung apt mirror can no longer stall a release.** v2.8.0's linux-musl
  build sat on `apt-get update` for 23 minutes without returning; the retry
  loop around it was useless, since a retry only helps a command that fails,
  not one that hangs. Each attempt now runs under `timeout 180`, with a
  15-minute step cap as a backstop.

## v2.8.0 — 2026-08-19

- **Drag the mouse across a pane to copy what you selected.** The transcript
  and the activity/diff pane sit side by side, so the terminal's own
  selection splices both columns of every row together — copying one error
  message, one path, or one code block out of rift meant hand-editing the
  result. Dragging inside a pane now selects that pane's text and copies it
  on release (system clipboard, OSC 52 over ssh). The selection is anchored
  to the text, not the screen, so it survives scrolling and streaming
  output; dragging past an edge scrolls; a code block's `│ ` gutter is
  dropped from the copy so pasted code stays pasteable; Esc clears the
  highlight. `Ctrl+T` still hands selection back to the terminal, and
  `/copy [all|log]` still takes a whole pane at once.
- **`/model` list picks now work when the session runs through a provider.**
  The picker listed the *current* server's models but emitted them as bare
  names, and a bare name is resolved against the default `host` — a
  different server, usually the localhost Ollama nobody configured. Picking
  a model from the list therefore failed with `error sending request for url
  (http://localhost:11434/api/show)`. Picker entries now carry the provider
  prefix, and a bare name the default host can't serve is retried against
  the session's provider instead of failing.

## v2.7.1 — 2026-08-09

- **VS Code: the auto-approve button can no longer fail silently.** Clicking
  it could do nothing at all, with no explanation: the config write was
  never error-checked (a rejected write surfaced only as an unhandled
  promise rejection), a workspace-scoped `rift.autoApprove` would shadow the
  global write so the effective value never moved, and a rift too old for
  `set_approval` was refused with a transcript line that scrolls away. All
  three now write to the scope the setting actually lives in, re-read the
  value to confirm it took, and report failure as a notification naming the
  cause — including the rift version when the binary is the problem.

## v2.7.0 — 2026-08-09

- **VS Code: a "working" indicator.** Three dots that bounce in a wave and
  cycle color sit at the end of the transcript from the moment you hit Enter
  until the turn is done — not just until the first token, so the wait while
  a local model thinks (and the long stretches during tool calls) reads as
  activity instead of a dead UI. They stay pinned below streamed content,
  and users with `prefers-reduced-motion` get a fade in place.
- **Auto-approve is now genuinely all-or-nothing.** `/yolo` (and the VS Code
  toggle) previously still stopped for `ask` permission rules and for
  untrusted project-plugin prompts, which made "no prompts" a half-promise —
  the worst of both, since you stop trusting the mode *and* stop reading the
  prompts. Approval OFF now suppresses `ask` rules too. `deny` is unchanged
  and still absolute: it refuses outright rather than asking, so it never
  depended on the approval mode. Anything that must hold regardless of mode
  belongs in `deny`, not `ask` — README and `/permissions` say so now.
  - Project-plugin **trust** prompts are skipped rather than auto-answered
    while auto-approve is on: not interrupting you for the agent's own edits
    is a different decision from consenting to run commands shipped by a
    cloned repo. The tools stay unregistered and an info line says why.
  - Those prompts are also deferred to the `hello` handshake now (which
    carries an optional `approve` field), so a consumer opening in
    auto-approve never flashes a question it would have suppressed.
- **VS Code: the approval button has exactly two states**, spelled out
  rather than left to an icon — **🔒 approve** or **⚡ auto** (lit amber).
  The "applies on the next session start" third state is gone: if the
  running rift is too old to switch, the change is refused with a warning
  instead of leaving the button claiming a mode rift isn't in.

## v2.6.6 — 2026-08-09

- **Auto-approve in the VS Code sidebar** (the TUI's `/yolo`, now in the
  editor): a 🔒/✓ button in the chat footer switches between approving each
  edit and letting them apply as the model makes them. The button lights up
  while it is on, the switch is announced in the transcript, and manual
  per-hunk review is one click away again — approval stays the default
  (`rift.autoApprove`, off). Also a **Rift: Toggle Auto-Approve** palette
  command and a settings-panel checkbox. It is not a permission bypass:
  `deny` rules still refuse and `ask` rules still prompt, so you can
  auto-approve broadly while keeping a gate on `Bash(git push *)` or
  `Edit(prod/**)`; applied edits still render as diffs in the chat.
- **Serve protocol: `set_approval`** (additive, still protocol v1 —
  docs/SERVE.md): flips approval mode on the running process with no
  restart and no lost conversation, acked with `approval_changed`; `ready`
  and `capabilities` now carry the current `approve` state so a consumer's
  toggle opens correctly. With approval off, no `edit_review` is raised at
  all — a frontend can never be left waiting on a diff nobody will decide.

## v2.6.5 — 2026-08-08

- **Bring-your-own system prompt** (TUI + VS Code): `/system save [text]`
  persists your own system prompt to `~/.config/rift/prompts/custom.md` —
  a `match: *` prompt target that replaces the built-in prompt for every
  model and session; `/system edit` opens it in your editor (applied when
  the editor closes), `/system reset` restores the built-ins, and bare
  `/system` now says which prompt is active. The VS Code sidebar gets a
  "system prompt" box in its settings panel backed by the same file, so
  both frontends share one source of truth. Concrete per-family override
  files still beat the wildcard, and `/system <text>` stays session-only.
- **Desktop app** (`desktop/`): a native shell for rift built with Tauri 2 —
  tabs (one conversation per tab, each its own `rift --serve` process),
  sessions sidebar with recent projects, inline per-hunk diff review
  (rift's `segments` hunking, decided before the write touches disk),
  streamed thinking/tool activity/plan/sub-agent lanes, @file mentions and
  `/skill:` completion, live model switching, context gauge, light/dark
  themes. No Electron, no Node runtime, no bundler: static frontend over
  the OS webview, one small Rust binary. `desktop-build` workflow produces
  NSIS/dmg/AppImage/deb bundles.
- **docs/PARITY.md**: a maintained feature-parity comparison against
  opencode (CLI, TUI, desktop) — ahead/at-parity/deliberate non-goals —
  with the benchmarked speed advantage as context.
- **`/share` — self-contained HTML transcript export**: renders the whole
  session to one `rift-share-<timestamp>.html` — inline CSS only, no
  scripts, no external assets. User turns as right-aligned bubbles,
  assistant prose on the left, thinking and tool calls/results as
  collapsible `<details>`, all content HTML-escaped and nothing truncated
  (unlike /export's tool-output preview). When the `gh` CLI is on PATH the
  command prints the `gh gist create` one-liner as the upload path — it
  never uploads anything itself.
- **`rift github install` — local-first GitHub integration**: writes a
  single self-hosted Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/rift.yml`) into
  the current repo. Maintainers comment `/rift <task>` on an issue or PR;
  a runner they control works the task headless against their own model
  server (`RIFT_HOST` secret, optional `RIFT_MODEL` variable), then pushes
  a `rift/issue-<n>` branch, opens a PR, and comments the result back.
  Gated in the workflow itself to commenters with write/admin association;
  refuses outside a git repo and asks before overwriting (refuses when
  non-interactive). Setup and security notes in docs/GITHUB.md.
- **LSP diagnostics on every edit** (opencode parity, token-lean): after a
  successful `write`/`edit`, rift syncs the file to the language's LSP
  server and appends any errors/warnings to the tool result —
  `path:line:col error: message`, capped at 10 lines — so the model fixes a
  broken edit in the same turn. Zero new dependencies: a minimal
  Content-Length-framed JSON-RPC stdio client in rift-core (`lsp.rs`), the
  same shape as the MCP client. Servers spawn lazily on the first edit of a
  matching file (rust-analyzer, pyright/pylsp, typescript-language-server,
  gopls, clangd) and only when the binary is on PATH; failures/timeouts
  degrade silently — the edit result is byte-identical to a no-LSP session.
  `/lsp` lists detected languages and server status; config `"lsp": false`
  disables, or a per-language map overrides/adds servers (user config only —
  a project `.rift.json` can only tighten).

## v2.6.4 — 2026-07-16

- **TUI input box scales with the window**: the prompt input rendered each
  line without wrapping and sized itself from newline count alone, so on a
  non-maximized (narrow) window a long typed line ran off the right edge —
  its tail, and often the cursor, were clipped until the window was widened.
  The input now hard-wraps to the pane width: long lines fold into as many
  rows as needed, the box grows with them up to a cap (then scrolls to keep
  the cursor in view), and its height is recomputed for the current width.
  A cursor at the end of a full-width line gets its own row so it's never
  clipped.

## v2.6.3 — 2026-07-12

- **Serve protocol: rift owns model discovery and switching** (additive,
  still protocol v1 — docs/SERVE.md):
  - `list_models` command → `models` event: every reachable model (default
    host + each configured provider as `provider/model`), probed
    server-side with the same routing the agent uses. The VS Code extension
    drops its JS re-implementation that read rift's config and probed
    servers itself — one source of truth, no drift.
  - `set_model` command → `model_changed` event: live model switch on the
    same conversation — the TUI's `/model` preflight-and-swap (now shared
    code, `switch_model`), so the extension stops killing and respawning
    the process on every dropdown change.
  - `ready.commands` advertises the command set for feature detection;
    the extension gates the new paths on it and keeps working against
    older binaries.
- **Serve protocol: `edit_review` events carry `segments`** — rift's own
  line diff (Myers, in rift-core) as alternating same/change runs, the
  authoritative hunking for inline review. The VS Code extension renders
  and reassembles accepted hunks from it instead of re-deriving a diff in
  JS (~140 lines deleted; older rifts degrade to whole-file review).
  Wire shapes pinned by the conformance suite; verified end-to-end against
  a live vLLM server (discovery, live switch, per-hunk apply to disk).

## v2.6.2 — 2026-07-12

- **README accuracy pass**: the tagline now reflects the multi-server
  reality (Ollama native + OpenAI-compatible servers first-class, cloud
  providers optional) and the actual ~14MB binary size; compaction is
  described as the shipped two-stage design rather than the aspirational
  "AST-based Compactor"; the workspace map gains the missing
  `rift-anthropic` crate and the full tool list; the sub-agents section
  documents orchestrate-by-default; stale model names updated.

## v2.6.1 — 2026-07-12

- **VS Code chat: ruled-line spam is gone for real**: the "phantom thin
  lines" had one more source beyond v2.6.0's fixes — models (DeepSeek
  especially) draw section separators and ASCII table borders as raw runs
  of `-`/`─`/`═` characters, which rendered as literal full-width dash
  lines. Any rule-only line now collapses to a single subtle horizontal
  rule, consecutive rules dedupe, rules at a message's edges are dropped,
  and fragments that render to nothing no longer open (or split) blocks.
  Reproduced and verified against a scripted model with the exact failing
  transcript shape. Note: chat rendering ships with the extension — update
  the .vsix; `rift update` alone only updates the binary.
- **`rift` startup no longer prints the `config:` line**: the provenance
  line is noise before every launch; `/config` in the TUI still shows which
  files loaded, and config warnings still print.
- **TUI transcript: real markdown tables and rules**: GFM pipe tables now
  render as aligned, truncation-aware columns with a highlighted header row
  and a rule beneath it, instead of raw `| a | b |` walls; `---` thematic
  breaks (and the long `-----`/`─────` rules models draw as separators)
  collapse to one clean horizontal rule. README demo GIFs re-recorded.
- **TUI activity pane: readable tool traffic**: tool calls now show the
  salient argument first with the JSON stripped (`→ bash python3 stats.py`,
  `→ edit stats.py old_string=… new_string=…`); bulky results summarize
  (`✓ read: 120 lines`, `✓ ls: 14 entries`, bash shows its first output
  line) instead of dumping flattened file contents; applied-edit previews
  color their +/− lines like a real diff.
- **`/model` only offers roles that are actually served**: configured roles
  (`models` in config, e.g. `fast`/`smart`) used to appear in the picker
  unconditionally — including roles whose model lives on a server that is
  offline or doesn't serve it anymore, a guaranteed-broken pick. Each
  role's own provider is now queried live (short timeout, one query per
  server); roles whose model isn't in a reachable server's list are hidden,
  with a count in the status line. The server's own model list was already
  live. The VS Code model dropdown already worked this way.
- **"Edit config, then `/restart`" now applies the edit**: `/restart` used
  to always relaunch with `--host <current>` `--model <current>`, and those
  flags outrank the config file — so a host or model you had just changed
  in the config was silently overridden by the old values, with a confusing
  "cannot reach …" for a server you no longer use. The restart now re-pins
  host/model only when they were pinned at launch (a CLI flag / env var) or
  switched mid-session (`/host`, `/model`); otherwise the relaunch re-reads
  config fresh.
- **Orchestration is the default, not an ask**: the deepseek and default
  system prompts now tell the model to delegate to sub-agents on anything
  that isn't a quick question or a trivial single-file change — no more
  typing "use subagents" per request. Quick lookups, obvious one-file
  edits, and follow-ups to in-conversation work stay direct. (The
  gemma/qwen/glm/mistral family prompts are unchanged — small local models
  orchestrate poorly, so delegation there stays opt-in.)

## v2.6.0 — 2026-07-11

- **Turns wrap up instead of dying at the iteration cap**: a busy model
  (e.g. DeepSeek-V4-Flash, which works in many small tool steps) used to hit
  the per-turn iteration limit and end with "stopped after N iterations
  without a final answer" — all the turn's work discarded. Now the agent
  warns the model two rounds before the cap, and on the final round sends
  the request without tools so the reply must be text: you get a real
  answer, or a handoff summary of what was completed and what remains
  (send "continue" to resume). Trace outcome "wrapped" and a
  "budget wrap-ups" counter in `/stats` make it visible.
- **Default iteration cap raised 25 → 40**: the doom-loop and stuck-turn
  guards already end wasted turns early, so the cap only ever throttled
  productive turns. Still configurable via `--max-iterations`,
  `max_iterations` in config, or the VS Code chat settings.
- **VS Code chat: red/green diffs for applied changes**: every `write`/`edit`
  the agent applies now shows as a compact diff card in the chat — the file
  path with `+N −M` counts, and the actual removed/added lines colored red
  and green (click the header to collapse). Backed by a new additive serve
  event, `edit_diff` (docs/SERVE.md); the TUI activity log and headless mode
  print the same ± preview.
- **VS Code chat: no more phantom blank lines**: DeepSeek-style models emit
  whitespace-only text fragments and stray ``` fences between tool calls;
  each one rendered as an invisible empty block (eating a row of spacing) or
  a bare code-block bar — the thin "ruled lines" littering the transcript.
  Whitespace-only fragments no longer open blocks (and no longer split the
  tool-activity box), and empty code fences are skipped.
- **DeepSeek prompt: batch independent lookups, delegate big work**: the
  deepseek-family system prompt now tells the model to issue independent
  reads/searches as multiple tool calls in one response instead of spending
  a round on each, and to act as an orchestrator on large tasks — delegating
  self-contained subtasks to the `agent` tool, where each sub-agent runs
  with its own fresh round budget and context window while costing the main
  conversation a single round.

## v2.5.1 — 2026-07-11

- **`rift update` no longer dies with "cannot move the running executable
  aside" on Windows**: updating parks the running `rift.exe` as `rift.old`,
  and Windows can't delete or replace that file while any process still runs
  the old image (say, a serve process the editor started before the last
  update). The next update's rename onto it then failed with Access Denied.
  Updates now park the running exe at the first *free* `.old` name
  (`rift.old`, `rift.old-2`, …) instead of clobbering, and best-effort sweep
  unlocked leftovers on each run so they don't accumulate.

## v2.5.0 — 2026-07-11

- **Resumed sessions keep their project understanding**: restoring a session
  (`--continue`, `--resume`, `/restart`, `/sessions`, and the VS Code chat's
  auto-resume) already replayed the conversation, but the model still
  re-explored the folder to reorient itself before answering. Resume now
  appends a hidden context note built from the saved history — the files it
  already read/outlined, the files it created or edited, how much other tool
  traffic ran, and whether older tool outputs were elided by compaction —
  telling the model its earlier understanding still stands and to build on
  it instead of re-scanning the project. The note is deterministic (no LLM
  call, works offline), never renders in any frontend, and stale copies from
  earlier restarts are stripped so they don't stack up.

## v2.4.1 — 2026-07-11

- **`rift update` output refreshed**: the update command now prints a clean,
  colored banner (`✦ rift updated · vX → vY`, the install path, and a restart
  hint) instead of a plain one-line summary, and no longer prints the
  `config: …` provenance line — it doesn't touch config. The in-TUI
  `/update` keeps its plain, ANSI-free line.

## v2.4.0 — 2026-07-11

- **VS Code chat: reopen past chats**: the chat no longer forgets your
  conversation when you reload the window or update the extension. Every
  session is already saved to disk; now the extension remembers the last
  session per workspace and **auto-resumes it on open**, and a new 🕘
  history button lists all past chats in a native quick-pick (titled by
  their first message, with age and turn count) so you can reopen any one.
  Model and settings changes also stay on the current chat instead of
  jumping to the newest. New serve-protocol command `list_sessions` →
  `sessions` event backs the picker (additive, still protocol v1).

## v2.3.1 — 2026-07-11

- **VS Code chat: rendered markdown tables**: the webview markdown renderer
  now parses GFM pipe tables (header, `|---|` delimiter, body rows, with
  per-column alignment) into real `<table>`s instead of showing raw pipes
  and dashes — so summary tables and the like read cleanly.
- **VS Code chat: tool activity is boxed**: a run of consecutive tool calls
  is now collected into a single height-capped, auto-scrolling box (with a
  click-to-collapse header and a live call count) rather than each `✓`
  line stacking down the transcript. A long burst of reads/edits no longer
  pushes everything else off-screen.

## v2.3.0 — 2026-07-11

- **`edit` no longer gets stuck on CRLF (Windows) files**: the `read`
  tool renders files with their `\r` stripped (`str::lines` drops it), so
  a model copying those lines back produced an LF-only `old_string` that
  never matched the raw CRLF bytes on disk. The `edit` tool now reconciles
  line endings — an LF `old_string` matches a CRLF file (and vice versa) —
  and the replacement preserves the file's existing convention on write.
  This removes the re-read/retry loop that ended in "stopped after N
  iterations without a final answer" on Windows projects.

## v2.2.0 — 2026-07-10

- **Project-plugin trust over the serve protocol**: untrusted project
  plugins are no longer silently skipped in `--serve` mode. Right after
  startup, each one arrives as an ordinary `ask` event (`choices:
  ["trust","skip"]`, the tool commands listed in `detail`) — so the
  VS Code chat (or any serve consumer) can approve it. Answering `trust`
  registers the plugin's tools into the running agent immediately,
  activates its post_edit hooks, and persists the approval in the same
  store the TUI's startup prompt uses (trust once, anywhere). Ignoring or
  skipping the ask fails safe; the manifest re-asks only if it changes

## v2.1.0 — 2026-07-10

- **`/release-notes`**: a closable popup showing what's new in the running
  version. The newest CHANGELOG section is embedded at compile time (so a
  binary always shows its own notes, even after `rift update`), rendered
  as a dimmed, scrollable overlay — `↑↓`/`j`/`k`/PageUp/PageDown to scroll,
  `Esc`/`Enter`/`q` to close. Also completes in the command palette
- **Getting-started tips**: a fresh session now prints a short "Tips for
  getting started" note under the banner (`/init`, `/release-notes`,
  `/help`); resumed sessions skip it — they already have history

## v2.0.0 — 2026-07-10

The agent platform. Breaking changes, bundled once — everything here was
previewed behind flags in 1.10/1.11, so 2.0 is a promotion, not a
surprise. The 1.0 stability promise resets for 2.x: config and protocol
stay stable, breaking changes need a 3.0.

- **Plugin API stable, on by default** (the `experimental.plugins` flag is
  accepted but no longer needed). A plugin directory can now contribute:
  - *commands* — prompt templates, surfaced like skills (`/skill:<name>`)
  - *tools* — subprocess tools; PROJECT plugins get the same one-time
    startup trust prompt as project hooks/MCP, keyed to the exact manifest
    (any edit re-prompts); user plugins register freely
  - *hooks* — `"hooks": {"post_edit": [...]}`; user plugins apply as-is,
    project-plugin hooks join the existing per-command trust flow
  - *themes* — `themes/<name>.json` ({"base": "dark", "accent":
    "#39c5cf", …}); also loadable outside plugins from
    `~/.config/rift/themes/`; `/theme <name>` resolves built-ins first
  - *prompt targets* — `prompts/<family>.md` from USER plugins only: a
    cloned repo must never replace the system prompt
- **Config schema v2, migrated automatically**: a v1 user config is
  rewritten in place on first load (backup: `config.json.v1.bak`);
  read-only configs use the migrated form in memory. Project `.rift.json`
  legacy `bash_deny` globs keep loading (tighten-only — dropping them
  would be a security regression) with a nudge toward
  `rift config migrate --project`
- **Serve protocol v1 frozen**, with two additive extensions: `ready`
  lists `skills` (skills + plugin commands) so editor chats can offer
  completion, and a prompt of `/skill:<name> [task]` expands server-side
  exactly like the TUI
- **VS Code extension parity**: typing `/` in the sidebar chat now
  completes skills and plugin commands (same popup as `@file` mentions,
  descriptions included) and invoking them runs the real skill expansion

## v1.11.0 — 2026-07-10

Platform preview (roadmap v1.11): everything 2.0 stabilizes ships here
first, behind flags — the breaking release becomes a promotion, not a
surprise.

- **Experimental plugin API** (`"experimental": {"plugins": true}` in the
  config): a plugin is a directory with `plugin.json`, discovered from
  `.rift/plugins/` (project) and `~/.config/rift/plugins/` (user).
  *Commands* are prompt templates (`{args}` = invocation arguments) and
  surface exactly like skills — `/skill:<name>` in the palette, listed to
  the model. *Tools* run a subprocess (args JSON on stdin, stdout is the
  result, nonzero exit = error, 60s timeout) — user plugins only in the
  preview: a cloned repo must not register commands to execute, so
  project-plugin tools are skipped with a pointed warning until 2.0's
  trust flow
- **Config schema v2 + migrator**: `rift config migrate` rewrites the
  deprecated `permissions.bash_allow`/`bash_deny` globs as `Bash(...)`
  rules, stamps `"version": 2`, and backs the original up as
  `config.json.v1.bak`; `--dry-run` previews, `--project` targets the
  project `.rift.json`. Runs before the normal config load, so a config
  broken enough to need migrating can't block the migrator
- **Deprecation warnings**: loading a config that still uses
  `bash_allow`/`bash_deny` warns they stop loading in 2.0 and points at
  the migrator — nothing 2.0 breaks goes unannounced

## v1.10.0 — 2026-07-10

Serve protocol v1 (roadmap v1.10): the `--serve` surface becomes a
contract third parties can build on.

- **docs/SERVE.md** documents every command and event — fields, semantics
  (one turn at a time, one id space, orphaned reviews closed, dropped
  replies deny), and the versioning rules: additive changes never break
  v1, consumers ignore what they don't know, and removals/renames bump
  the protocol version (a 2.0-class change)
- **`protocol_version`** now rides in the `ready` event, and `hello` is
  acked with a `capabilities` event carrying the negotiated set — a
  consumer can confirm exactly what it's speaking to
- **Conformance tests** pin every event's exact wire shape in serve.rs;
  a failing test means a breaking protocol change and says so
- **Reference client**: `scripts/serve_client.py` — an interactive minimal
  integration (spawn, hello, prompt, stream events, answer asks, decide
  reviews) for Neovim/JetBrains plugin authors; SERVE.md's integration
  guide walks through it
- The VS Code extension (the reference consumer) checks
  `protocol_version` and warns on a mismatch instead of failing weirdly

## v1.9.0 — 2026-07-10

Distribution, finished (roadmap v1.9) — plus the long-standing quick wins.

- **winget**: `scripts/make_winget.sh vX.Y.Z` generates the manifest trio
  from a release's published checksums; the release workflow auto-submits
  version updates to microsoft/winget-pkgs via wingetcreate once the
  `WINGET_TOKEN` secret exists (first-time submission is manual — see
  packaging/winget/README.md)
- **crates.io**: rift-provider/ollama/openai/anthropic/core now carry full
  publish metadata and the release workflow publishes them in dependency
  order once `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` exists — `rift-ollama` and friends
  usable as standalone dependencies
- **`--version` update nudge**: `rift --version` reports a newer release
  when the 24h update-check cache knows one — cache-only, never a network
  call, so offline machines never stall. Headless runs print the same
  nudge to stderr after the turn (stdout pipelines unaffected)
- **`/copy` palette completion**: typing `/copy ` offers `all` and `log`
  with descriptions, prefix-filtered like command completion
- **Palette mouse-wheel**: the wheel moves the selection in the command /
  @file popup instead of scrolling the pane beneath it
- **Session file size cap**: autosaves stay under 10MB — whole turns are
  trimmed from the front (system prompt kept, tool-call pairs never
  split). Live context is untouched; compaction still owns that

## v1.8.0 — 2026-07-10

Model targets: each open-model family treated as a compiler target, with
the bench matrix as the fitness function (roadmap v1.8).

- **Family prompt targets**: `qwen`, `deepseek`, `glm`, and `mistral`
  prompt files embedded alongside `gemma` — each tuned to its family's
  documented failure modes (qwen: narration and double-verification;
  deepseek: reasoning spill and over-exploration; glm: chat-only answers
  and reply language; mistral: exact-match edit retries without whole-file
  rewrites). All provisional until they clear the evolution gate on a
  matrix run; models with no family target keep `default` exactly as before
- **Prompt evolution gate**: `scripts/prompt_gate.py --family F
  --candidate f.md --models m1,m2` benchmarks the embedded incumbent, then
  the candidate as a user-level override (no rebuild), and diffs pass
  rate, prompt tokens, wall time, and the per-turn failure counters from
  traces — printing a PR-ready verdict. A candidate merges only if it wins
  on every model
- **Tool-schema A/B**: `RIFT_TOOL_SCHEMA=lean` serves every tool with a
  first-sentence description and no per-parameter docs — structure
  (types, required, enums) is untouched. `bench.py --schema lean|rich`
  drives it and tags each result row with the variant, so schema cost can
  be measured per model family instead of assumed
- BENCHMARKS.md records the methodology and the planned validation matrix

## v1.7.3 — 2026-07-10

- **`"editor"` config key**: set the `/config edit` editor in rift's own
  config (`"editor": "code -w"`, flags allowed) instead of wrestling with
  `$EDITOR` on Windows. Precedence: config → `$EDITOR` → `$VISUAL` → the
  terminal-editor PATH probe. Loads from the user config only — a cloned
  repo's `.rift.json` must never choose what command runs — and
  hot-reloads with the rest of the config
- **`/config edit` says what it's opening**: the resolved editor and where
  it came from ("opening config in vim… (default — set \"editor\" in the
  user config or $EDITOR to change)"), so the PATH-probe pick is never a
  surprise
- **Broken JSON no longer strands the config**: saving a config that fails
  to parse now keeps the previous settings live and reports the exact
  error with line and column, pointing back at /config edit — instead of
  a bare reload error with the settings in limbo
- **Merge-to-release**: merging a version bump to master now tags and
  publishes the release automatically — the release workflow spots a
  Cargo.toml version with no matching tag and cuts `v<version>` itself.
  Manually pushed `v*` tags still work exactly as before. The pipeline is
  resilient to transient CI flakes: shell network steps retry, and a
  failed build/package leg (e.g. a DNS blip on artifact upload) re-runs
  its failed jobs automatically, capped at three attempts

## v1.7.2 — 2026-07-09

- **Default editor opens in the terminal**: with no `$EDITOR`/`$VISUAL`
  set, Windows no longer defaults `/config edit` to notepad popping the
  file open in a separate window. The default now probes PATH for a
  terminal editor — `edit` (Microsoft's terminal editor, in-box on
  Windows 11), then nano, vim, nvim, vi, hx, micro — and opens it in the
  terminal via the usual TTY handover. Notepad remains only as the last
  resort when no terminal editor exists; an explicitly set `$EDITOR` is
  respected as before

## v1.7.1 — 2026-07-08

- **Robust Windows shell quoting**: the bash tool ran commands through
  `cmd.exe /C` with Rust's default (MSVCRT-targeted) argument quoting, which
  cmd.exe re-parsed under its own rules and mangled — a `python -c "import
  x"` argument reached the shell as a broken `"import` and every quoted
  command failed. The command line is now built with `raw_arg` and `/S`, so
  cmd strips exactly the outer quote pair and runs everything inside
  untouched, preserving any quoting for any command shape (foreground,
  background, and post-edit hooks; composes with the sandbox wrapper)
- **Stuck-turn guard**: the doom-loop guard refused identical repeats but
  let the turn grind on to `max_iterations` (25 wasted steps), re-warning on
  every repeat. A running count of tool calls that failed or were refused
  without any success between now nudges the model to change tack at 4 and
  ends the turn cleanly at 7 — catching both an exact-repeat loop and a
  model varying a broken call slightly, while leaving legitimate iterative
  debugging alone (a success resets the streak). The repeat warning fires
  once per signature, not per repeat
- **Config editing keeps the TUI visible**: `/config edit` no longer blanks
  the terminal while a GUI editor (notepad, VS Code, …) holds the file in
  its own window. The TUI stays up, dimmed behind a "close the file to
  continue" modal, and hot-reloads when the editor window closes. Terminal
  editors (vim/nano) and anything unrecognized keep the full-TTY handover

## v1.7.0 — 2026-07-08

- **Granular permission rules**: `permissions.allow` / `ask` / `deny` lists
  of `Tool(pattern)` rules — `Bash(git push *)`, `Edit(src/**)`,
  `Read(~/.ssh/**)`, `Fetch(*://*.internal/*)` — with precedence
  deny > ask > allow > approval mode. Deny holds everywhere: YOLO mode,
  headless runs, inside grep/glob walks, `ls` of a covered directory, and
  across fetch redirects (re-checked per hop). Ask rules force a prompt
  even in /yolo (and deny headless); allow rules load from the user config
  only — a project `.rift.json` can add deny/ask but never allow. Matching
  is hardened: paths canonicalize first (symlinks, `..`, `\\?\` verbatim
  prefixes, case-insensitive on Windows/macOS), bash rules see the same
  `${IFS}`-folded chained segments as the deny list, URLs normalize
  scheme/host/default-port. Edit approval prompts offer a persistent
  "always allow `Edit(<dir>/**)`" scoped to the file's work area;
  `/permissions add|remove <allow|ask|deny> <rule>` edits rules live; the
  legacy `bash_allow`/`bash_deny` globs still load as `Bash(...)` rules
- **Inline diff review in VS Code — per-hunk accept/reject**: every
  write/edit the agent proposes opens as a native VS Code diff *before it
  touches disk*. Accept or reject each hunk via CodeLens (rejecting one
  visibly removes its change), apply with the ✓ title-bar button, and
  track pending reviews as chat cards (Apply / Open diff / Reject). Only
  the accepted hunks are written, the model is told when a proposal was
  partially applied, and `/undo` still restores the true prior state.
  Serve protocol: consumers opt in with `{"cmd":"hello","edit_review":true}`,
  then receive `edit_review {path, old, new}` events and reply with
  `edit_decision`; cancelled/finished turns emit `edit_review_closed` so a
  stale Apply can't claim success. Consumers that never say hello (older
  extensions, scripts) keep the classic in-chat approval prompts
- **Context-window gauge**: the TUI status bar shows `ctx 42% 13k/32k`
  next to the model chip (green under 60%, amber to 84%, red above) and
  the VS Code chat header shows a matching color-coded `ctx 42%` pill with
  token counts on hover — the calibrated estimate of what the conversation
  occupies (system prompt + history + tool schemas) vs the working
  `num_ctx`, refreshed at startup and after every turn, command, and
  compaction. New serve event `context {used, limit}`; `ready` now
  carries `num_ctx`

## v1.6.4 — 2026-07-07

- **Multi-agent visibility in the VS Code chat**: when rift fans work out to
  sub-agents (the `agent` tool) or background tasks, the chat shows a live
  card per agent — pulsing status, model, task label, and the agent's own
  scrolling activity feed — instead of flat interleaved log lines, plus a
  running-agent count in the header status (`⧉ 2 running`). Cancelled turns
  sweep their agent lanes closed
- **Structured sub-agent events**: new `AgentEvent::SubAgentStarted /
  SubAgentActivity / SubAgentFinished` variants replace preformatted Info
  strings, emitted over `--serve` as `subagent_started` / `subagent` /
  `subagent_finished`. The TUI, swarm UI, and headless output render
  byte-identical lines to before

## v1.6.3 — 2026-07-07

- **Instant hover tooltips in the VS Code chat**: every control shows a
  styled, theme-aware hover box immediately (native `title` tooltips were
  delayed and easy to miss on small icon buttons), with fuller descriptions
  of what each button actually does; icon buttons got bigger hit areas
- **Full-view settings panel**: the ⚙ settings are now an overlay covering
  the chat with one labeled field per option — binary path, server URL,
  context window (`--num-ctx`), temperature (`--temp`), max iterations
  (`--max-iterations`), reasoning effort — each with an explanatory
  tooltip. New VS Code settings: `rift.numCtx`, `rift.temperature`,
  `rift.maxIterations`
- **Removed `rift.extraArgs`**: the raw pass-through is superseded by the
  dedicated fields above

## v1.6.2 — 2026-07-07

- **Syntax highlighting in the VS Code chat**: fenced code blocks render
  with highlight.js (vendored, pinned 11.11.1 — webview CSP allows no CDNs),
  matching VS Code's default dark/light token colors and following the
  active theme. Labeled fences highlight directly; unlabeled ones
  auto-detect against a shortlist of common languages
- **Code block buttons**: hovering a block shows **copy** and **insert** —
  insert places the code at the cursor in the active editor, replacing the
  selection if there is one
- **CI: bump actions to their Node 24 majors** — checkout@v7, setup-node@v6,
  upload-artifact@v7, download-artifact@v8, action-gh-release@v3 — clearing
  the Node 20 deprecation warnings

## v1.6.1 — 2026-07-07

- **@-mention file picker in the VS Code chat**: typing `@` opens a popup of
  workspace files and folders (keyboard navigation, live filtering, picking
  a folder drills into it), fed by the extension host with junk directories
  excluded — no more typing paths by hand
- **Readable tool output in the VS Code chat**: a tool call's start and
  result now fold into a single row (`✓ bash command=… → 100`), and clicking
  it expands the full arguments and output in a scrollable block. Thinking
  blocks auto-scroll while streaming (no more mid-line clipping), click to
  expand, and thinking after a tool call starts a new block below it instead
  of appending above out of order
- **Undo from the chat**: new `{"cmd":"undo"}` in the `--serve` protocol
  reverting the last turn's write/edit changes via the same journal as the
  TUI's `/undo`, surfaced as an ↶ button in the chat header (bash-made
  changes stay untracked, same as the TUI)
- **install.sh: remove the old binary before installing** — overwriting it
  in place kept the old inode, and macOS SIGKILLs binaries whose cached
  code signature no longer matches

## v1.6.0 — 2026-07-07

- **VS Code sidebar chat**: a full chat UI backed by a new `rift --serve`
  JSON-lines protocol over stdio — streaming replies, tool activity,
  inline approval prompts (diff preview + allow/deny), the plan checklist,
  and new/continue session controls. Lives in its own activity-bar
  container, so it drags to the secondary sidebar and sits beside the
  editor. In-chat **model dropdown** discovers every model rift can reach
  (default host plus configured providers, as `provider/model`) and
  switches mid-conversation via `--continue`; a ⚙ settings panel edits the
  binary path, server URL, and reasoning-effort (dropdown, not a raw flag),
  with a button to open rift's own config for providers/permissions
- **`rift --serve`**: editor-integration mode — one JSON event per line on
  stdout, one command per line on stdin, approvals and `ask_user`
  questions surfaced as `ask` events answered by id. The safety model is
  identical to the TUI (approval on by default)
- **Harden the bash deny list against expansion tricks**: `bash_denied`
  now folds whitespace-producing expansions (`${IFS}`, `$IFS`, `$@`, `$*`)
  to spaces and splits on `$` before matching, so `rm${IFS}-rf${IFS}/` and
  `sudo${IFS}whoami` no longer slip past the built-in patterns. Remains
  best-effort (approval mode is the real gate), but the documented bypass
  is closed

## v1.5.3 — 2026-07-07

- **VS Code extension** (`vscode/`): rift in VS Code's integrated terminal
  with the complete feature set (it runs the real binary), plus editor
  glue — launch/continue commands with keybindings, a status-bar button,
  and right-click "Add File/Selection to Prompt" that types `@file`
  mentions into rift's input. Configurable binary path, host, model, and
  extra args; empty settings defer to `.rift.json`. Releases now attach
  `rift-vscode.vsix` — install with `code --install-extension`

## v1.5.2 — 2026-07-07

- **Responsive startup banner**: the RIFT logo is now drawn to fit the
  pane on every re-wrap — a larger pixel-block render at 2× on wide
  terminals (84+ cols) or 1× (42+), the compact box-drawing version
  below that, and plain text on slivers. Centered, resizes live, and
  never garbles on narrow terminals

## v1.5.1 — 2026-07-07

- **Startup banner**: a RIFT ascii-art logo (accent-colored, never
  re-wrapped on narrow terminals) opens the transcript, with a
  `v<version> · <model>` tagline beneath. The "session resumed" marker
  now keys off actual seeded history instead of transcript emptiness

## v1.5.0 — 2026-07-07

- **`web_search` tool + `/search`**: web search through a self-hosted
  SearXNG instance (`search_url` in config, or `/search <url>` — probed
  via the JSON API before adoption and persisted to the user config;
  `/search off` disables). Local-first: queries go to YOUR metasearch
  box, not a third-party API. Sub-agents inherit it
- **`/deep-research <question>`**: a research workflow through the normal
  agent loop — decompose into search angles, `web_search` each, delegate
  source-reading to concurrent sub-agents (fetch + verbatim quotes +
  dates), cross-check claims across sources (corroborated vs
  single-sourced), and synthesize a cited markdown report with a
  numbered source list. Verified live end-to-end
- **Project memory**: `.rift/memory.md` loads into the system prompt every
  session — durable facts that compound over time. Grown by `/remember
  <fact>` and by the model's new `remember` tool (short entries enforced,
  exact duplicates refused, 16KB cap with a prune hint, prompt budget
  capped separately from the guides)
- **`/fork`**: duplicate the conversation into a NEW session file and open
  a second rift window resuming the copy — parallel exploration with full
  context, original untouched. New console on Windows, Terminal via
  osascript on macOS, $TERMINAL/x-terminal-emulator/gnome-terminal/
  konsole/xterm on Linux
- **`fetch` tool**: built-in web fetch — GET a URL, strip HTML to
  readable text (script/style/comment-aware), 20KB cap, 20s timeout.
  Docs pages and READMEs without an MCP server; search still belongs to
  MCP (`/mcp add`)
- **Sandbox wrapper**: `permissions.bash_wrapper` routes every bash
  command (foreground, background, sub-agents) through a containment
  tool — `"wsl -e sh -c '{cmd}'"`, Docker, firejail, bwrap. Real
  isolation from tools built for it, not a homemade half-sandbox; the
  deny list and approval still inspect the raw command. User config
  only; shown in /permissions

## v1.4.0 — 2026-07-06

- **Remote MCP servers (streamable HTTP)**: config entries and
  `/mcp add <name> <url>` now take a `url` instead of a command — one
  POST per JSON-RPC message, plain-JSON and SSE-framed responses both
  handled, `Mcp-Session-Id` captured and echoed, custom `headers` for
  auth tokens. Trust identity covers url + headers
- **Interactive background tasks**: the `task` tool (and `/tasks send` /
  `/tasks eof`) can write lines to a running task's stdin and close it —
  REPLs, y/n prompts, and read-to-EOF filters are now drivable
- **`/paste`**: attach a clipboard image to your next message
  (PowerShell / pngpaste / wl-paste+xclip per platform)
- **`--output-format json`**: headless runs print one machine-readable
  result object (reply, tool calls, token/duration stats, estimated
  cost, session path) on stdout with progress on stderr — verified live
- **Anthropic prompt caching**: cache_control breakpoints on the system
  prompt and the conversation tail, so agent-loop iterations re-read the
  prefix from cache instead of re-billing full input price

## v1.3.0 — 2026-07-06

- **Hooks — automatic post-edit verification**: `"hooks": {"post_edit":
  ["cargo check --quiet"]}` runs after every successful write/edit; a
  failing hook's output (capped, ANSI-stripped, with exit code) is
  appended to the tool result so the model fixes broken builds/tests in
  the same turn. Successes log a `hook ✓` line. Project-config hooks
  need one-time trust at startup (they auto-execute; a cloned repo must
  not get that for free); sub-agents run the same hooks
- **Checkpoints — `/rewind [n]`**: restore the write/edit changes AND
  the conversation of the last n turns together (session file rewritten,
  transcript reseeded, up to 20 turns back). The undo journal now keeps
  20 turns instead of 3. Like Claude Code checkpoints, bash-made changes
  are outside the journal; compaction clears rewind marks
- **Agent personas**: `.rift/agents/<name>.md` (project) or
  `~/.config/rift/agents/` (user-wide) define custom sub-agent types —
  frontmatter `name`/`description`/`model` (role or full name)/`tools`
  (whitelist) plus a prompt body layered onto the base system prompt.
  Tasks select one with `agent: "<name>"`; configured personas are
  advertised to the model. Verified live end-to-end
- **Diff preview in approvals**: write/edit approval prompts now render

  region, capped at 40 lines) above the allow/deny question — you review
  what you're approving, not a byte count

## v1.2.0 — 2026-07-06

- **Image attachments for vision models**: `@photo.png` in a prompt (or
  `--attach <path>` headless) attaches the image as base64 — ask about
  screenshots, diagrams, error dialogs. One neutral form (data URLs on
  the message), translated per provider: Ollama's bare-base64 `images`
  array, OpenAI `image_url` content parts, Anthropic image source
  blocks; wire shapes pinned by tests and verified live against a
  vision-capable Ollama model. Text mentions keep the outline treatment;
  images cap at 10 MB; attachments persist in the session. Headless
  `--attach` also appends text files to the prompt
- **`/mcp add [--global] <name> <command> [args…]`**: connect an existing
  (off-the-shelf) stdio MCP server from inside the TUI — e.g.
  `/mcp add fetch uvx mcp-server-fetch`. The server is spawned and its
  tools verified BEFORE anything persists, registered live (no restart),
  and saved to the project `.rift.json` (pre-trusted — typing the entry
  is the consent the trust gate collects) or the user config with
  `--global`. Complements config-file entries and `/mcp new`
- Fix: after Esc-cancelling a turn, the model resumed the interrupted
  task on the next (even unrelated) message — the abandoned instruction
  was still the last word in history. Cancelled turns now mark the agent
  interrupted, and the next input carries a note that the task was
  deliberately abandoned and must not be resumed unasked
- Fix: resumed sessions rendered expanded command prompts (/mcp new,
  /init, …) as page-long user-colored walls, flattening the transcript —
  live sessions only ever showed the line the user typed. Seeded user
  messages now collapse to their first 8 lines + a count, and the
  Esc-interrupt note is stripped from display

## v1.1.1 — 2026-07-06

- **`/host` autodetects the server type**: probes the model list on both
  protocols (URL shape picks the order — `…/v1` tries OpenAI-compatible
  first) and adopts whichever answers, so `/host http://box:8000/v1`
  switches straight to a vLLM/LM Studio/llama.cpp server. The default
  host is protocol-aware everywhere now: bare `/model` switches, startup
  (`host` in config may be a `/v1` URL), `/restart`, and the context
  budget adoption all follow the detected kind. Ad-hoc hosts run keyless
  — keyed endpoints still belong in `providers`
- Fix: `/restart` relaunched against the STARTUP host — a `/host` switch
  never reached the restart spec (only the model survived). The UI now
  tracks host switches, so restart resumes on the current server

## v1.1.0 — 2026-07-06

- **Model roles — optional multi-model workflows**: a config `models` map
  names roles ({"smart": "vllm/…", "fast": "gemma4:26b"}), and each
  agent-tool task can set `model` to a role name or full model string —
  so one session plans/reviews on a strong model and delegates
  implementation to a cheap one (cross-provider: an Ollama child under a
  vLLM session works). Children on a different model get fresh
  think/effort defaults (capability checks don't transfer); routing
  failures surface as tool errors before anything runs. The system
  prompt advertises configured roles, and `/model`'s picker lists them
  first. No `models` map = exactly the old single-model behavior

## v1.0.5 — 2026-07-06

- Fix: picking a theme from the `/theme` picker failed with "unknown
  command '/theme'" — the picker forwarded its selection to the agent-side
  command dispatcher, but the theme is UI state. Both the picker and the
  typed form now share one UI-side switch (regression-tested)
- **Reasoning-effort levels**: `/think` now takes
  `minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|max` alongside on/off/auto (a level
  implies thinking on), plus `--effort` and `"effort"` in config. One
  neutral knob, translated per provider: Ollama's graded string `think`,
  OpenAI/DeepSeek `reasoning_effort` + `thinking:{type}` toggle (per the
  DeepSeek V4 thinking-mode API), Anthropic-format
  `output_config.effort`. The OpenAI form also carries vLLM's
  `chat_template_kwargs` variant ({"thinking": bool, "reasoning_effort":
  …} per the DeepSeek-V4 vLLM recipe) — verified live against a vLLM
  DeepSeek-V4-Flash: thinking off/high/max produced 0/49/260 reasoning
  chunks. DeepSeek requirements honored: sampling params drop in
  thinking mode and `reasoning_content` is passed back during tool
  loops. Servers that reject any of the params get one retry without
  them, so an effort set on a model that can't grade is a no-op, not a
  failure

## v1.0.4 — 2026-07-06

- Fix: headless (`-p`) runs hung forever after printing their final line —
  the background-task registry held a clone of the event channel sender,
  so the output printer's wait for channel-close never ended and every
  headless run since v1.0.0 left a zombie rift process. The registry now
  detaches its channel before the final wait (regression-tested)

## v1.0.3 — 2026-07-06

- **10 new color themes**: `dracula`, `nord`, `gruvbox`, `solarized-dark`,
  `solarized-light`, `tokyo-night`, `catppuccin`, `rose-pine`, `matrix`,
  `synthwave` — truecolor palettes that paint their own text, background,
  and border colors (the classic `dark`/`light`/`mono` stay
  terminal-native). The `Theme` struct gained `fg`/`bg`/`border`; bare
  `/theme` now opens an interactive picker, and each theme's syntect
  mapping is pinned by test

## v1.0.2 — 2026-07-06

- **Claude Code-style permissions**: interactive sessions now **ask before
  write/edit/bash by default**, and each bash prompt offers allow once /
  **always allow `<pattern>`** (e.g. `git push *`, persisted to
  `permissions.bash_allow` in the user config — never prompts again) /
  allow all bash this session / deny. Allow-listed commands run silently;
  chained commands need every segment allowed; the deny list still always
  wins. A project `.rift.json` can only tighten (its `bash_allow` is
  ignored, its `approve: true` is honored, `approve: false` is not).
  Opt out with `"approve": false` in the user config
- **`/yolo [off]`**: stop asking before write/edit/bash entirely (the
  built-in + configured deny list is still enforced); `/yolo off` restores
  prompts. `/permissions` now shows allowed and banned patterns side by
  side
- **`/btw <question>`** (modeled on Claude Code's /btw): a quick side
  question that sees the whole conversation but has no tools, never enters
  the main history (the agent never sees the exchange), and runs on a
  UI-side task — so it works even while the agent is mid-turn. Follow-up
  `/btw`s continue a small side thread (kept to the last 10 exchanges,
  `/btw clear` resets it); answers render as dimmed `(btw)` blocks,
  buffered so a streaming main turn is never garbled. Context comes from
  the session autosave (history up to the last completed turn); the side
  question always uses the session's current model

## v1.0.1 — 2026-07-06

Verified against DeepSeek V4 Flash on vLLM; fixes for OpenAI-compatible
providers generally:

- **Context-length discovery**: `show()` now reads the model's context
  window from `/v1/models` (vLLM `max_model_len`, OpenRouter
  `context_length`, LM Studio `max_context_length`, llama.cpp
  `meta.n_ctx_train`). When the user hasn't set `--num-ctx`, provider-routed
  models adopt the reported context as rift's working budget (capped at
  128k so huge hosted contexts don't bloat every request); `/model`
  switches retune the budget the same way. Ollama keeps its conservative
  default — there num_ctx sizes the server's KV cache
- **Real throughput stats**: the OpenAI-compatible path now measures
  stream timing (prefill = to first chunk, decode = rest), so tok/s shows
  real numbers instead of 0.0 in the status line and `/stats`

## v1.0.0 — 2026-07-06

- **Concurrent sub-agents**: the model gets an `agent` tool — 1–4
  self-contained tasks run as concurrent child agents, each with its own
  context window, tool set, plan, and undo journal (permission policy and
  the ask channel are shared; nesting is blocked). Foreground calls wait
  and return every child's final report; `background=true` launches them
  as background tasks that keep working across turns. `/model` and
  `/host` switches carry over to children automatically
- **Background tasks**: `bash run_in_background=true` starts a command as
  a session-wide background task and returns its id immediately — it
  keeps running while the conversation continues. Output accumulates in
  a capped buffer; the new `task` tool lists/inspects/kills tasks; the
  status bar shows a live "N bg tasks running" count; and when a task
  finishes on its own, a `[task notification]` auto-turn hands the result
  back to the model (kills are silent, Esc suppresses pending
  notifications, at most 8 tasks run at once). `/tasks [kill <id>]` is
  the user-facing view of the same registry. Background tasks terminate
  with the rift process — no orphans

## v0.9.5 — 2026-07-03

- **`/goal <condition>`**: keep working until the model verifies the goal —
  turns auto-continue (up to 25) until a verified line-anchored `GOAL MET`,
  `/goal clear`/Esc stops it, and the run cap stops with a resume hint.
  A failed turn pauses the goal instead of spinning
- **`/loop [30s|5m|2h] <prompt or /command>`**: re-run a body on a fixed
  interval (rescheduled from fire time — no catch-up bursts) or
  back-to-back without one; `/loop stop` or Esc ends it, and a
  back-to-back loop halts if a run fails. Esc during a running auto-turn
  cancels the turn and the automation
- **Generator scope**: `/skills new` and `/mcp new` take `--global` (`-g`)
  to install user-wide (`~/.config/rift/`, every project, absolute paths,
  no trust prompt) instead of the project-scoped default (`.rift/`,
  trust-gated)

## v0.9.4 — 2026-07-03

- **Self-extension**: `/skills new <desc>` — the agent writes its own skill
  file from your description; `/mcp new <desc>` — the agent writes,
  self-tests, and registers a local stdio MCP server (stdlib-only Python),
  trust-gated like any project-config server. `/restart` loads either
  without losing your chat
- MCP client accepts the common bare-content-array `tools/call` result
  shape instead of silently reading an empty string

## v0.9.3 — 2026-07-03

- Fix: `/restart` before the first turn crashed the relaunch ("EOF while
  parsing a value") — session files are reserved empty at startup and
  resume now handles that (and missing/corrupt files, which back up to
  `.json.corrupt`) gracefully instead of failing startup. Also fixes the
  latent `rift -c` crash after quitting an unused session

## v0.9.2 — 2026-07-03

- **`/restart`**: relaunch rift and resume the exact session in place —
  the post-`/update` path that keeps your chat. True exec on Unix (same
  terminal, same PID), spawn-and-wait on Windows; `/update`'s success
  message now points at it
- The status line and `/restart` carry the addressable model name
  (provider prefix intact), so `anthropic/…` models survive a restart

## v0.9.1 — 2026-07-03

- **Markdown rendering in the transcript**: `## headings` render bold in
  the accent color, bullets become `•`, `inline code` and **bold** get
  span colors — raw markdown from the model no longer displays as plain
  text. Fence-tag coverage pinned by test (markdown/md/json/yaml/diff/…)
- Prompts now ask models to put document/file-content answers in a
  language-tagged fenced code block, so they render in the highlighted box
- Explicit content requests ("do not use any tools", "in a code block")
  no longer trip the apply-nudge, which could make the model discard the
  requested content on its retry

## v0.9.0 — 2026-07-02 · v0.8 phase complete: context engine v2

- **Hydrate-on-demand reads**: an unbounded `read` of a 500+ line source
  file returns its line-numbered outline instead of a 2000-line dump; the
  model then fetches exact ranges (offset/limit always verbatim). Measured
  on the hard tier: **−18.4% prompt tokens** suite-wide, −66% on the
  buried-bug big-module task, pass rate held (docs/BENCHMARKS.md)
- **Repo-map centrality ranking**: files ranked by import in-degree first,
  recency as tiebreak — central modules make the map even when untouched;
  falls back to pure recency when no imports resolve. Imports cached
  alongside outlines
- Traces record each tool call's file/pattern target (data for future
  retrieval tuning)
- `bench.py --runs N` (per-run pass counts + flaky-task list) and
  `RIFT_BIN` override for old-vs-new binary A/Bs

## v0.8.1 — 2026-07-02

- **Persistent outline cache**: repo_map outlines cached per repo root
  keyed by (mtime, size) — a hit skips the file read and the tree-sitter
  parse; best-effort JSON under the user data dir
- **Idle-time compaction**: the context-budget check also runs right after
  each turn, so pruning/summarizing happens while you read the reply
  instead of mid-turn while you wait
- **Hard-tier benchmark suite** (`bench/tasks2/`, `--dir tasks2`): 10
  harder tasks — multi-file symptom-not-location bugs, fix-the-failing-test
  with tamper guards, needle-in-a-haystack long-session modules, a
  cross-file signature refactor
- **First judge-accuracy results**: qwen3.6:35b judging gemma4:26b vs
  ornith:35b races went 14/14 on discriminative cases (see
  docs/BENCHMARKS.md)
- Community docs: CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, issue templates
- Demo GIF in the README (reproducible VHS tape committed)
- Packaging: Homebrew formula generator + release-workflow tap
  automation, scoop manifest with autoupdate

## v0.8.0 — 2026-07-02 · v0.7 phase complete: cloud + swarm

- **Cross-provider WarpDrive**: one swarm race can mix providers — each
  candidate's model string (`gemma4:26b` vs `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`)
  resolves through a provider factory to its own client
- **Swarm auto-judge** (`--judge <model>`): a referee model scores every
  candidate's diff and recommends a winner; TUI shows the verdict in the
  winner's log, `--no-tui` prints a machine-parseable `JUDGE: winner=` line
- **Cost display** for metered providers: `/stats` and the headless summary
  show estimated $; billed input tracked as summed per-call prompt tokens;
  built-in Anthropic rates plus a config `pricing` map
- `bench/judge_bench.py`: measures judge accuracy against verify-script
  ground truth (discriminative-case accuracy is the headline number)
- Swarm diffs exclude interpreter cache junk (`__pycache__`, `*.pyc`) that
  unfairly penalized candidates in judged races

## v0.7.2 — 2026-07-02

- First per-model prompt target shipped provisionally: `gemma.md` puts the
  tool-application contract first (from trace analysis: 8 of gemma4:26b's
  10 bench failures were chat-only answers)
- The apply-nudge now keys on *mutating* tool use (write/edit/bash), closing
  the explored-but-never-edited escape
- Fixed `t12_cents` bench task (was unpassable: float-representation trap)
- 3-model matrix results published in README/BENCHMARKS

## v0.7.1 — 2026-07-02

- **Turn traces + failure counters**: opt-in `--trace <file>` / `RIFT_TRACE`
  JSONL records model, tokens, tool calls, hardening/failure counters, and
  outcome per turn; `/stats` shows a recoveries line
- **Prompt-target machinery**: per-model-family system prompts compiled into
  the binary (`crates/rift-core/prompts/<family>.md`), selected by model
  name, user-overridable via `~/.config/rift/prompts/`
- **Bench model matrix**: `bench.py --models a,b,c` runs the suite per model
  and diffs pass rate / tokens / wall time; `--tasks` subset filter

## v0.7.0 — 2026-07-01 · cloud providers

- **Native Anthropic provider**: the Messages API spoken natively (SSE
  content blocks, tool_use/tool_result, thinking with signature round-trip);
  `anthropic/<model>` works with just `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the env
- `openai/<model>` built-in provider over the existing OpenAI protocol
- Fenced code blocks render as labeled boxes in the TUI

## v0.6.4 — 2026-07-01

- Per-provider hardening test suite: deterministic mock-server tests in CI
  (SSE/NDJSON framing, mid-stream errors, tool-call accumulation,
  truncation detection) plus env-gated live suites against real servers

## v0.6.3 — 2026-07-01

- Completed the v0.5 UX scope: `@file` mentions with palette completion,
  syntax highlighting (syntect, feature-gated), live diff pane (Ctrl+D),
  built-in themes (`dark`/`light`/`mono`)

## v0.6.2 — 2026-07-01

- Config merge semantics: project `.rift.json` overlays the user config;
  permissions only tighten (deny-list union, approve stays on)
- `/mcp trust` management; transport retries

## v0.6.1 — 2026-07-01

- Hardening sweep: data safety, provider robustness, MCP trust gating for
  project-defined servers

## v0.6.0 — 2026-07-01 · provider abstraction

- `Provider` trait extracted — Ollama becomes one implementation
- **OpenAI-compatible provider**: vLLM, LM Studio, llama.cpp server,
  LiteLLM, OpenRouter; per-provider base URLs and keys in config
- Token accounting normalized across providers

## v0.5.1 — 2026-06-30

- Ctrl+C no longer exits the TUI (use `/quit`)

## v0.5.0 — 2026-06-30 · command + UX expansion

- New slash commands: `/retry`, `/stats`, `/system`, `/temp`, `/ctx`,
  `/worktrees`, `/save`, named `/sessions`, `/quit`
- Startup resilience: unreachable server or missing model opens the TUI
  anyway with a recovery hint

## v0.4.x — 2026-06-11 → 2026-06-28 · plan view + trust

- Plan tool with live activity-pane checklist; `ask_user` elicitation;
  interactive `/model` and `/sessions` pickers
- Approval mode (`--approve`): y/n gate on write/edit/bash with per-session
  always-allow
- Agent Skills standard (`.rift/skills/` SKILL.md), `/skill:<name>`
- RIFT.md / AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md auto-loaded into the system prompt
- Full input-line editing (cursor movement, word jumps, bracketed paste)
- Cross-platform: Windows support (cmd.exe shell, USERPROFILE fallback,
  install.ps1), CI build/test matrix on macOS/Linux/Windows
- 50-task benchmark vs opencode: 44/50 vs 42/50, −57% prompt tokens,
  3.4× faster (see docs/BENCHMARKS.md)

## v0.3.x — 2026-06-11 · polish

- `rift update` self-updater with startup check and `/update`
- `/copy` command and Ctrl+T native-selection toggle
- Paste truncation, ANSI corruption, and false-hang fixes
- Model-failure harness: timeout salvage, server probe, edit hints

## v0.2.0 — 2026-06-11

- Slash-command palette popup

## v0.1.0 — 2026-06-11 · initial release

- Native Ollama `/api/chat` terminal coding agent: pre-wrapped flicker-free
  TUI, AST-based context compaction, textual tool-call recovery, doom-loop
  guard, WarpDrive worktree races, MCP, 16 slash commands
- Release pipeline: CI, cross-platform builds, one-line install script
